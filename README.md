# Writeup

My solution uses a main loop with a delay at the end to control "framerate".
I based the other delays around the framerate as well, like for button b.
Nanorand is used for rng in generating a new board, but the microbit's own rng 
is obtained each frame for uses in seeding the generation of a new board.
The first "game" always uses the same seed, but every new board after that uses 
a random one generated by the microbit. I tried to do some stuff with states 
and enums, but I decided it didn't help with how short my code was.
